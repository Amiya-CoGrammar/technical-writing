# Technical Writing

For some reason, there are only a relatively small number of people who are interested in both technology and language. If you are one of them, technical writing can be a great profession, or means of generating a side income. 

This repository is a collection of technical writing resources. Pull requests to add more resources are highly encouraged.

## Writing Resources

## About
I have been writing technical articles on a freelance basis for a number of years. I'm always surprised that while there are thousands of posts and resources out there relating to helping you become a better (programmer|founder|data scientist|anything else) there is very little about technical writing, and many people don't even know that technical writing is a thing that exists and that pays. 

This is my little attempt to fill that gap. I plan to extend it in future with information about publishing companies and writing tools. If you have suggestions for more sections, or want to add to existing sections, please submit a pull request. If you're not comfortable with git, [email me](gareth@dwyer.co.za) or [Tweet at me](https://twitter.com/sixhobbits) with your suggestions.
