## Articles

### 'How to Write with Style' by Kurt Vonnegut
Vonnegut presents 8 concise rules. He reminds us to 'sound like ourselves' -- something which is perhaps more difficult but still important in technical writing. http://www.novelr.com/2008/08/16/vonnegut-how-to-write-with-style.

### Material.io's writing guide
This aims at language use for user interfaces, but it has many nice rules with concrete, short examples for each. The sections on Tone and Punctuation are applicable to general technical writing.

### Essays on CIA writing
This is an interesting, but not that useful, collection of essays about writing well. They are from 1962 and were originally classified, but have since been released. You'll find the usual "avoid the passive voice and jargon" type of advice. The original essays can be found here https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-00915R001400200001-3.pdf and a higher level write-up about them here https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/jul/14/cias-style-guide/

## Books

### 'On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction' by William Zinsser
Zinsser describes writing as a craft, comparing it to carpentry. He focuses on teaching you how to edit, claiming that first drafts are never good. The earlier chapters provide general writing and editing advice, while the later ones are topic-specific and cover travel writing, technical writing, memoir writing, etc. 

*The following books are not specific to technical writing. However, their advice on general writing definitely applies to technical writing as well*

### 'The Elements of Eloquence' by Mark Forsyth
This book teaches the lost art of rhetoric in a highly entertaining fashion. Each chapter is an explanation -- containing many hilarious and self-describing examples -- of a simple rule to make your writing sound better and be more persuasive. You can read it cover-to-cover, or open it at random. 

### 'On Writing' by Stephen King
This book is half an autobiography of Stephen King and half writing advice. Although it is aimed more at fiction writers, the advice is generic and sound and the personal describing the hardships King went through before becoming a famous writer are inspiring.

### 'Practical Typography' by Matthew Butterick
Formatting and layout of text on a page or screen is an area of writing that's often overlooked or thought of as "someone else's job". However, with the modern prevalence of independent web publishing, where the writer and typographer will often be the same person, it's useful to know the basics of good typography. In describing their typography, Butterick also covers concepts valuable to technical writers such as effective emphasis and how to best present lists and hierarchies of headings.

The book is availabe online only at http://practicaltypography.com/ -- as payment, Butterick encourages a donation or a purchase of one of his excellent fonts.

### 'The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the 21st Century' by Steven Pinker
Linguist Steven Pinker takes an analytical approach to writing in this style guide, with chapters about reverse-engineering good prose, seeing the grammatical trees in sentences in order to untangle them, and how a writer's intimate knowledge of a subject may distort their writings about it (the biggest problem with much academic and technical writing). Much time is also spent investigating the rules of English grammar and dispelling the many myths that have grown up around it.

## Meta
*Something as meta as writing about writing would be complete without a meta section of its own. Here are some articles that already collect and describe other works on writing.*

### Good Plain English: The problem with writing manuals 
Nat Segnit discusses six books about writing. Nat gives some entertaining examples, some focused on contemporary American politics. http://harpers.org/archive/2017/03/good-plain-english/
